= Stranded-api

Install Ruby and Rails

Install the Gems using 
    bundle install

Install PostgreSQL (you need to run the db locally)

Set a user(role) called 'rails'. This is so that rails can access the db as needed
    $ psql -d postgres
    postgres=# create role rails login createdb;
    postgres=# \q

Run 
    rake db:setup

All REST APIs have a subdomain of api. e.g. if you are running the server on lvh.me:3000, apis are located at api.lvh.me:3000
